Decription:
Estimated home-court advantage and team strength parameters by season, using Model II from Harville and Smith, 1994, "The Home-Court Advantage: How Large Is It, and Does It Vary from Team to Team?". The model is applied to both Men's and Women's games, but limited to Division 1 teams and regular season games. The most updated results include Men's model output from 1984-1985 to 2018-2019 season and Women's model output from 2001-2002 to 2017-2018 season.
